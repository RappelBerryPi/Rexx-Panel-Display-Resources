# Rexx-Panel-Display-Resources
This is a sample set of rexx programs and panel definitions that can be used to display panels. This is a very light introduction into using ISPF services on a ZOS mainframe. All code was developed on the Open Mainframe initiative. Open to the public. More information about the Open Mainframe project can be found at https://www.openmainframeproject.org/
